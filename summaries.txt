The Jao Gap, identified in Gaia Data Release 2 and Early Data Release 3, presents a way to study the interior structure of stars near the fully convective transition mass. It is believed to originate from a convective-kissing instability wherein asymmetric production of 3He causes the core convective zone of a star to periodically expand and contract, thus causing the star luminosities to vary. Modeling of the Gap has shown sensitivity to population metallicity primarily through opacity. Current models of the Jao Gap have relied on OPAL high-temperature radiative opacities, but here updated synthetic population models traced the Gap location modeled with the Dartmouth stellar evolution code using the OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities. The use of updated opacities changes the predicted location of the Jao Gap by about 0.05 mag as compared to models that use the OPAL opacities. However, this difference is likely too small to be detectable in empirical data.
The paper discusses the convective-kissing instability, which is responsible for periodic luminosity variations in stars, and its relation to the Jao Gap, a gap observed in the color-magnitude diagram of low-mass stars. The paper also explores the effects of metallicities and opacities on the location and properties of the Gap, suggesting that the Gap's mass location is correlated with model metallicity and that the opacity is an unexplored parameter that has the potential to resolve discrepancies in its precise location in the CMD. The paper provides details on updated high-temperature opacity tables released by different groups such as the Opacity Project and Los Alamos National Labs.
This page discusses the use of high-temperature opacity tables in the DSEP stellar evolution program. The updated opacity tables use measurements from the Los Alamos national Labs T-1 group and were created with the modern LTE and non-LTE opacity and plasma modeling code ATOMIC. The OPLIB tables provide monochromatic Rosseland mean opacities for elements hydrogen through zinc over temperatures of 0.5 eV –100 keV and for mass densities from approximately 10−8gc m−3up to approximately 104gc m−3. The authors found that OPLIB opacities are systematically lower than OPAL opacities for temperatures above 105K. A web scraper, pyTOPSScrape, was developed to automatically retrieve all the tables needed to build an opacity table in the OPAL format. The mass/density and temperature are used as opposed to using the R(Equation (2);T6=T×10−6, where ρis the mass density) and composition.

Title: "The Jao Gap Revisited: Consequences of Updated Opacities for Low-Mass Stellar Models"
Publication: The Astrophysical Journal, 944:129 (10pp), 2023 February 20

The authors validate the OPLIB opacities by generating a Solar-Calibrated Stellar Model (SCSM) and confirm that the model's surface Z/X abundance is within one part in 100 of the solar value. The OPLIB and OPAL based models show differences in hydrogen mass fractions and convective mixing length parameters. The authors model the Jao Gap using two extremely fine mass grids of models that use a solar composition, a FreeEOS configuration, and pre-main-sequence polytropic models as their initial conditions. The models include gravitational settling, and a maximum allowed time step of 50 million years is set to fully resolve the build of core 3He in gap stars. They use instantaneous mixing as a valid approximation, given the short mixing timescales in low-mass stars, and find that the diffusive model of convective mixing is not necessary. The authors present the HR diagram for the two SCSMs and the mass-luminosity relation for models evolved using OPAL and OPLIB opacity tables. The OPLIB opacity based models show a lower-mass range for the Jao Gap.
The authors use a population synthesis code to compare the Jao Gap to observations, calibrated by the GCNS (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) and equations (3) and (4). The code includes both photometric and astrometric uncertainties. They then test the Gap's sensitivity to the mixing length by evolving OPLIB models with different mixing lengths. They find an inverse correlation between the mixing length parameter and the magnitude of the Gap, with a shift of up to 0.3 mag. The mixing length provides a free parameter to better match observations without impacting the models' effective temperature.
This page discusses the limitations of using solar-calibrated mixing length for all stars in determining the location of the Jao Gap. It suggests that adjusting the convective mixing length parameter may provide a better fit, but there are uncertainties in this approach for stars other than those with effective temperatures similar to the Sun. The authors present their results from identifying potential gaps in synthetic populations using their gap identification method and provide the location, prominence, and width of the two gaps found in both OPAL and OPLIB models. They caution against using the Jao Gap magnitude to calibrate a mixing length value without considering other uncertainties in the stellar models.
This page of the scientific paper discusses the identification of multiple gaps in stellar models in relation to convective mixing events and mass. The width of the gaps decreases as they move to lower masses and redder colors. While previous modeling efforts have not identified multiple gaps, it is likely due to varying metallicities and using coarse underlying mass grids. The mean gap location of the OPLIB population is at a fainter magnitude compared to the OPAL population, which indicates that the convective mixing events begin happening at lower masses in the former. Mixing events at lower masses in OPLIB models are due to a thicker radiative zone, which takes more time to break down. The authors note that Jao & Feiden (2020) have located the gap at a similar location in the GCNS data, and they are conducting further work to incorporate metallicity variations.
This academic paper investigates the Jao Gap in M-dwarf stars, comparing the accuracy of traditional OPAL opacity tables to newer OPLIB ones. The authors find that OPLIB tables reproduce the Jao Gap location and structure more accurately, but the gap remains poorly captured by a single value due to its downward-facing wedge shape. Both the color and magnitude of the gap is correlated to the convective mixing length parameter. However, the shift is small enough that it is likely not distinguishable from noise due to population age and chemical variation. Future measurement of [Fe/H] may help to constrain the degree to which the gap should be smeared by theoretical models. The OPLIB opacity tables do not help to reproduce the wedge shape of the observed Gap. This paper is supported by a NASA grant and employs software such as pyTOPSScrape and the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program.
The authors describe the process of generating opacity tables for use in stellar evolution models. They discuss the difficulties in converting opacity tables from a density and temperature parameterization to a density and radius parameterization. Instead of directly specifying radii through density ranges, they query tables over a broad temperature and density range, then rotate the tables by interpolating κR(ρ,Teff)→κR(R,Teff) using a cubic bivariate B-spline. They validate this interpolation by performing a similar interpolation in the opposite direction and comparing the raw opacities to those that have undergone the double interpolation. The mean fractional difference is found to be very small along the models in the Jao Gap mass range. However, interpolation-edge effects cannot be avoided when interpolating back into the ρspace. The authors provide references for their work.
